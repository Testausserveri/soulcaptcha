# SoulCaptcha

This project was created at Stupid Hack 2022 -hackathon by [@builder-247](https://github.com/builder-247) and [@ahnl](https://github.com/ahnl).

The idea was to create a typical scam page "congratulations, you won an iPhone, give us your details to claim the prize", but with a plot-twist. The scam wouldn't actually be the typical scam page, but rather the captcha part of it. We mislead visitors to draw their signature as an anti-robot verification measure, but really they sign a contract to relinquish their soul to a big corporation.

Hosted demo is available at https://winprizes.testausserveri.fi. The whole app can be also run easily from the source using:
```
$ docker-compose up
```
